This is a minimal MDX post. If you can read this on `/blog/hello-world`, the build worked ðŸŽ‰.

## Introduction

A short section to demonstrate the Table of Contents.
You should see a **Contents** box on the left (desktop) or above (mobile).

### What you can test

- Headings (`##`, `###`) appear in TOC.
- Footnotes like this[^note] render below.
- Code blocks show a *Copy* button:

```ts
export function add(a: number, b: number) {
  return a + b;
}
```

[^note]: This is a sample footnote. Click the backlink to return.
